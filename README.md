## Features
- Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV and face_recognition libraries.
- Firebase integration for storing student data and attendance records.
- Easy-to-use interface with visual feedback for attendance status.
- Automatic encoding of student images for face recognition.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Firebase account and project setup
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ChandrakantBudhalakoti/Face-Recognition-Attendance-System.git
cd face-recognition-attendance
```

### Install Required Packages
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Firebase Setup
1. Place your Firebase service account key (`serviceAccountKey.json`) in the project root directory.
2. Update the Firebase configuration in the Python scripts if necessary.

## Usage

### Encode Student Images
1. Place student images in the `Images` folder. The image filename should be the student ID (e.g., `1.jpg` for student ID 1).
2. Run the `Encodegenerator.py` script to encode the images and save the encodings:
    ```sh
    python Encodegenerator.py
    ```

### Add Data to Database
1. Update the student data in `AddDatatoDatabase.py`.
2. Run the script to add the data to the Firebase database:
    ```sh
    python AddDatatoDatabase.py
    ```

### Run the Main Script
1. Start the webcam and begin the face recognition attendance system:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
